# Comp-Graphic-and-Visualization



This project has been an enlightening journey into the world of computer graphics, specifically focusing on the use of standard OpenGL. Prior to this, I had no experience in coding computer graphics of this nature, making this a novel and enriching learning experience. It was fascinating to delve into the intricacies of the algorithms that operate behind the scenes, driving the visuals displayed on the screen.

The approach I adopted for this project was one of careful and gradual implementation. I made slow, incremental changes, ensuring at each step that everything was functioning as expected. This was crucial given the nature of debugging OpenGL code, which can be quite challenging. Unlike other types of code, OpenGL doesn’t always throw an error when something goes wrong. Instead, certain elements may simply stop displaying, or their textures and shading might appear distorted. Therefore, a cautious approach was necessary to prevent any major issues.

I firmly believe in the value of making small, incremental changes to code. This strategy allows for the steady development of an idea while minimizing the risk of introducing breaking changes that could be difficult to debug if they were part of a larger update.

When it comes to developing programs for personal projects, I prefer a more hands-on approach. Rather than spending a lot of time planning, I enjoy diving straight into the coding process and bringing my ideas to life on the screen. While I recognize that this approach might not be suitable for enterprise-level software development, it works well for my personal projects, which are typically smaller in scale. However, I am fully aware that for larger scale projects, thorough planning is definitely required.

The development of my 3D scene was a constant learning process. I found myself continually seeking out different resources, from websites to video tutorials, to help me understand OpenGL and its functions. Grasping how it all worked was a significant challenge, but with time and perseverance, I eventually got the hang of it.

Each milestone in this project introduced another layer of complexity, from adding colors to incorporating textures and lighting. The complexity kept piling up, necessitating constant refactoring of my code to implement these changes. However, since each milestone focused on implementing only a few changes at a time, I found the task manageable.

Studying computer science will equip me with a theoretical understanding of computers. Gaining a fundamental understanding of how computers work will be incredibly useful if I am seeking a job in the technology sector. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation upon which I can build my career.

Looking ahead, I aspire to develop games after I graduate. Understanding how computer graphics work will be invaluable in an industry that revolves around interactive digital storytelling and entertainment. The skills and knowledge I’ve gained from this project will undoubtedly serve me well in my future endeavors.
